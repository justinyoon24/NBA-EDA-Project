# NBA-EDA-Project
From this data, I hoped to learn/explore the relationships between different team stat variables such as rebounds, blocks, assists, 3 pointers made, etc. and winning percentages for teams. As an avid fan of the NBA, over the years I've noticed the game slowly evolving to emphasizing the 3 point shot due to its efficiency. I had a hunch that the data will reveal that teams that make more 3's per game have higher win percentages. I also hoped to learn from this EDA if different team stat variables have an inter-relationship with the number of 3 pointers made. The data I am using can be found at https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/traditional/?sort=W_PCT&dir=-1. The data set includes data on team win percentage, points, 3 pointers made, free throws made, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, etc. all on a per game basis
